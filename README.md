# fsbb
Finite State Building Blocks is a C++ library for quickly building finite-state machines, geared toward game development.

## FSMs

TODO: Describe why FSMs are useful in general, and in game programming in particular, give links to description of FSM and State pattern in GPP.

[Finite-state machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine) find wide use in programming

## Overview of other libraries

Boost.StateChart/??? - geared toward static, code-generated FSMs, less useful for registring states on the fly, very cumbersome to use
TinyFSM - also static, requires on to write states inside machine itself

## Goals

FSBB is meant to provide building blocks for both statically-defined and dynamically-defined machines, etc.
FSBB is a header-only library, no need for compilation, is written without using C++11 features.

## Example

1) An example of definition of FSM from prefab

2) An example of custom-build FSM
